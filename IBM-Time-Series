Probably the best model since all graphs indicate good fit and AIC and CBS values
are the smallest amongst the models.	
Maximum Likelihood Estimation indicates that both AR(1,1) and MA(1,1) are of siginficance, i.e.
both are < 0.05.
Residual analysis also shows no significant autocorrelations and partial autocorrelations.
Also residuals look fairly normally distributed.

The ARIMA(1,1,1) model can be written as 
(1 - 0.99992 B) Nabla Z_t = (1 + 0.29295 B) a_t
